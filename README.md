# Polynomial Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **Polynomial Regression** using Python. The dataset used is `Employee_Salary2.csv`, and the goal is to understand how polynomial regression can model non-linear relationships.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about employees' salaries based on experience or other factors. The regression model is trained to predict salaries more accurately than a simple linear model.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## 🚀 Installation
To run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohit-8626/Polynomial-Regression.git
   cd Polynomial-Regression
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Polynomial_Regression.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Results
- Visualizes the dataset and polynomial regression curve
- Compares linear vs. polynomial regression performance
- Evaluates model using R² score and error metrics

## 📜 Future Improvements
- Add more polynomial degrees for comparison
- Implement feature scaling for better results
- Explore other regression techniques like Ridge or Lasso
